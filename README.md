Customer Churn Analysis – Telecom Sector

This project presents a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a telecom customer dataset to investigate the patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn. Using Python, the analysis explores how variables such as contract type, internet service, payment method, and customer demographics affect the likelihood of churn.

The notebook includes clear visualizations and insights that can support strategic decision-making aimed at improving customer retention. It serves as a strong foundation for building predictive models or business intelligence dashboards in future stages.

Project Objectives

* Explore and clean the telecom churn dataset
* Visualize customer attributes and their relationship with churn
* Identify key drivers contributing to customer churn
* Provide business-level insights to guide retention strategies

Key Findings

* Month-to-month contracts : are strongly associated with higher churn.
* Lack of services such as  Tech Support, Online Security, and Backup increases churn risk.
* Customers using Electronic Check as a payment method churn more frequently than those using automatic payments.
* Customers without partners or dependents are more likely to leave the service.

These insights are supported by well-structured visualizations such as count plots and bar charts.

Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas – data manipulation and cleaning
* Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization
* Jupyter Notebook – interactive development
